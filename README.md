# Hotel_Rating
This project will focus on TripAdvisor customer review data about a particular hotel. The data is in a json file. To help the hotel understand the feedback the reviews provide, and what it might suggest they should focus on to improve customer experience, you'll extract each reviewer's ratings of the hotel and will summarize them. You'll save the ratings and the written reviews in separate files that others can use. You'll use Python data structures like dicts, json objects, and pandas DataFrames and Series.
